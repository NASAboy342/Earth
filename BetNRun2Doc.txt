% Smooth Animation & Effects: Adding fluid transitions when the chicken runs could make it feel more dynamic.

% Betting Logic & Rewards: How will players place bets, and what factors influence their winnings?

% Obstacles & Random Events: Introducing elements like wind gusts or falling objects could add suspense.

% Database for Player Stats: Since you’re familiar with SQLite, maybe track player decisions for analytics or progression.


$ Adding obstacles and random events will make the game feel more dynamic and increase player engagement. $

1. Defining Obstacle Behavior
You might want to introduce:

Wind Gusts: A chance-based event that can push the chicken forward or backward unpredictably.

Falling Objects: Randomized hazards that appear on the path, requiring quick decision-making.

Slippery Tiles: Certain sections of the wall could make stopping harder, forcing a slide forward.

2. Implementing Random Events
Use a random number generator to trigger events unpredictably.

Set probability values (e.g., 20% chance of a wind gust on every move).

Introduce subtle animations to show events unfolding—like a breeze effect for the wind.

3. Balancing Risk & Reward
If events make running riskier, reward players who successfully navigate them.

Allow limited-time bonuses for dodging obstacles.



Falling objects will create tension and force players to think fast. Here’s how you can implement them step by step:

1. Define Falling Objects
You’ll need to decide:

What kinds of objects fall? (e.g., rocks, crates, or even playful distractions like a balloon)

How often do they fall? Randomized with a probability system.

Do they damage the chicken, slow it down, or force a stop?
